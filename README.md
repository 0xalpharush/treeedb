# treeedb

`treeedb` is a Rust library and collection of executables for generating
relational views of [tree-sitter][tree-sitter] parse trees. These views may be
used as inputs to a Datalog program or to construct a relational database.

The name is a portmanteau of "tree-sitter" with "EDB", where EDB stands for
"extensional database" and refers to the set of facts in a Datalog program.
